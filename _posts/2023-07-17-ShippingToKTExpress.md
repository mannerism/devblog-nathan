## Backflash

Now that I have the clothes from TJ Maxx and also declared what company I am going to export with, all that is left is to send it to the KT Valley Branch in Silicon Valley so they can ship the package to South Korea. This process is rather simple as all is needed is to ship the package to their branch in California, and they will do the rest internationally.

## How will the Clothes get to CA?

While there are many options available for shipping to the Silicon Valley Branch, the price is the biggest issue. Because the box for clothes is about the size of a large box(8” x 7” x 11”), I just need to find a company that can get our clothes to the shipping address quickly and cheaply.

This company was FedEx, being able to ship a large box (8-3/4” x 7-3/4” x 11-5/16”) in about 3 of 4 days for less than `$30`.

Other big name companies like UPS, USPS, DHL, and more were too expensive or annoying to use, but FedEx's process was rather simple. All that was needed was to create a shipping label by stating the box size, the location of delivery, and when to ship it.

## Step 1

To create the shipping label, the first step is to out in the location. Because KT Express already gave us the specific address of their Silicon Valley Branch, this process was pretty easy. The information was already easily accessible and took little time to find.

## Step 2

To create the shipping label, the second step is to select an option. Choosing the One Rate was signifigantly cheaper than the standard rates, almost a `$30` difference. I'm not too sure why the difference was so high as the package is only about 8 pounds as well, but either way the One Rate was always a better deal.

## Step 3

After choosing the box size and the shipping date, FedEx offers the estimated rate that will be required depending on the deliver services. While some choices are astronomically expensive such as the First Overnight, the Express Saver option at the latest is rather cheap. Thus, choosing the latest deliver made it just over `$25` with tax.

## What can we Take from this?

The issue coming into play with this shipping process is how will we ship our product to the conusmers quickly enough to where they will still want the product. Shipping takes quite some time if I go the cheaper route, but it could take too long for customers to find tolerable. On the contrary, going the faster route could be way to expensive, and the consumer could see the shipping cost too high. One loophole that is helping us exponentially is the sheer cheapness of KT Express. The entire process of getting out product from Silicon Valley, CA to South Korea was under `$50`. This is much better of an option than delivering internationally with FedEx or another company as this would increase to over `$200`. This advantage of cheaper delivery could be used to ship faster domestically and hopefully shrink the amount of time customer will wait.

Another issue could be seen in delivering the products for multiple customers. Shipping one or two orders at a time would be too inefficient and expensive, but doing too many in bulk may be difficult to sort out once the products arrive. This will be important to consider at the end of the day once we end our first trial of shipping the TJ Maxx Clothes.
