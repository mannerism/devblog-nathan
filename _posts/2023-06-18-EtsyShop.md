As I began to brainstorm ideas for my new online business, I ma de a MindMap to help facilitate my thinking. I started out by figuring out what is essential for an Etsy Shop. Well, it includes figuring out what to sell, how to sell it, and overall how to make the most money.

## What to sell

The first component I covered was what to sell. Because Etsy is predominantly used for  selling clothes, I decided to follow a similar approach along with the many current sellers. As I scrolled through the page, I found that many teenagers sold vintage, streetwear clothing. This is currently a trend among the younger generation, and thus following such a path would hopefully be good for my business as well.

Etsy is a phenomenal way to make passive income as people can easily come and go, viewing my listings and buying the clothes they want. Just like any retail website, I can compete with many big name companies mainly with cheaper prices and trendy styles popular with many different audiences. Price is the biggest issue when people buy new clothes, and as such I can compete relatively easily with almost half those prices.

The setup process is very simple as well. To create an Etsy shop, all you need to do is create an account, sign up with your bank information, and create your first listing. Additionally, the use of ads, sales, and marketing on multiple social media platforms makes Etsy a very reliable option in the flexibility shop managers have on their sales. The versatility of having hundreds of listings as well as the onsite and offsite options for ads makes Etsy viable for many people. With the ads specifically, you can optimize your exposure both on the Etsy item feed and even offsite on Google, Facebook, Instagram, Buzzfeed, etc.

## How to Design

Now that I knew what to make, I needed to find out how to execute it. Because I am not very good at art design, I had to utilzize Midjourney, the AI drawing tool to create some new logos that I could put onto the clothes. This is a fantastic way for me to gain a competitive edge while not having my art skills hinder my sucess.

Midjourney is run through Discord as the AI bot. I simply type in a prompt and the bot will create 4 images based on the phrase. What is so revolutionary about this is that I spend no effort or time in creating the images and I have a huge range of access to any type of image I want. Whether it is clipart, nature backgrounds, or even real people, I can access anything without spending any effort.

## How to Produce

Now that the game plan for finding what to sell and how to design it, I had to figure out how to actually product it. To do this, I found the Print-on-demand idea would be perfect, as I wouldn't have to worry about selling every item in my inventory and could watch as more and more people simply bought the item.

As such, Printify was the best option I could find, with many cheap options for producing the clothes and it also had the print-on-demand option that was perfect for me. Not only that, but Etsy also direclty works with Printify, making the procecess of manufacturing and selling the products very accessible. With Etsy shoppers demanding many types of clothing and designs, Printify gives us the opportunity to meet these high demands without spending too much effort.

## The End of the Creation Process

With that, I am now ready to start actually selling clothes online through my Etsy shop. However, to truly hit the ground running, it is important that I do some research on what kind of tips and tricks I can utilize to get the most attention and sales to help me through the hardest part of small businesses: getting the first large margin of sales.
