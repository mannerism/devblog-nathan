## Pouring Out New Ideas

As I began to brainstorm ideas for my new online business, I made a MindMap to help facilitatae my thinking. I started out by figuring out what is essential for an Etsy Shop. Well, it includes figuring out what to sell, how to sell it, and overall how to make the most money.

## What to sell

The first component I covered was what to sell. Because Etsy is predominantly used for  selling clothes, I decided to follow a similar approach along with the many current sellers. As I scrolled through the page, I found that many teenagers sold vintage, streetwear clothing. This is currently a trend among the younger generation, and thus following such a path would hopefully be good for my business as well.

## How to Design

Now that I knew what to make, I needed to find out how to execute it. Because I am not very good at art design, I had to utilzize Midjourney, the AI drawing tool to create some new logos that I could put onto the clothes. This is a fantastic way for me to gain a competitive edge while not having my art skills hinder my sucess.

## How to Produce

Now that the game plan for finding what to sell and how to design it, I had to figure out how to actually product it. To do this, I found the Print-on-demand idea would be perfect, as I wouldn't have to worry about selling every item in my inventory and could watch as more and more people simply bought the item.

As such, Printify was the best option I could find, with many cheap options for producing the clothes and it also had the print-on-demand option that was perfect for me.

## The End of the Creation Process

With that, I am now ready to start actually selling clothes online through my Etsy shop. However, to truly hit the ground running, it is important that I do some research on what kind of tips and tricks I can utilize to get the most attention and sales to help me through the hardest part of small businesses: getting the first large margin of sales.
