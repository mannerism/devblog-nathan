## Ideation Candidate 1

---

### Candidate Title

Youth Wanted

### Problem

Students want to participate in side-hustle but they lack professional qualification to apply for jobs or internship.

or

High school students (my peers) want to participate in side-hustle opportunities but don't know much about available options.

### Solution

Solution: Explore high school studentsâ€™ competitive edge and help them leverage that advantage over adults

- active participation in Social Media, i.e. Short form videos (tik tok, instagram, youtube)

*Option 1:*

- Use it as a marketing channel
- Mission based marketing campaign where students can participate using their own social media accounts

### Field Interview Questions

For the interviews, I can be much more general to the audience rather than being too specific. There is not select target audience yet, so instead I am going to talk to many students to get an understanding of basic interests, hobbies, etc. During these interviews, it would be optimal to ask open ended questions to dive further deeper into the conversatino and learn the most from every student.
