## Quantitative Data + Better Method

Previously in our survery, I asked more basic questions to understand the basic needs of the general population. However, in our new questionnaire, I used a more analytical approach to get our new information.

The biggest factor that changed this survey was the use of quantiitave data rather than qualitative data. Instead of qualitative questions asekd to gain information specific to each individual, quanititative date includes more basic responses that can be used to understand what a population is thinking. By giving multiple choice questions as well as asking respondents to answer on a scale from 1 to 5, I was able to group certain responses together and create an average group that could be insightful on what is currently a big issue.

 Additionally, the use of Google Forms not only makes the tracking of the information easier but it is more efficient in getting responses and holding the information. By simply providing the surveyr to many people, they can easily fill it out in 5 minutes or less rather than the indepth qualitative interview.

### What Were the Questions?

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdmfz9bs/image/upload/v1686019981/Screen_Shot_2023-06-05_at_8.52.41_PM_awgfqr.png)

The questions I used were more emphasized on studying what jobs and side-hustles people have as well as analyzing what kind of entertainment and social media people use. To get a more specific and taylored response from our users, the use of multiple choice and scale questions were the best to get a wider range of data from respondents.

**To understand what people do for jobs/side-hustles, I asked:**

- Q1: Do you think you have enough spending money?
- Q2: Do you currently have a side job/side hustle?
- Q2-1: How many hours do you put into your job every week?
- Q2-2: What do you do for work?
- Q2-3: How satisfied are you in your job?
- Q3: How many jobs have you had?
- Q4: Do you have any intentions to find a new job?
- Q5: Have you made money outside of your main job?

**As for activites done in freetime and social media use, I asked:**

- Q6: What do you like to do in your free time?
- Q6-1: if you choose Social Media, Which one do you have?
- Q7: How long do you use social media?
- Q8: How experienced are you at making TikTok videos or Instagram posts?
- Q9: How many combined followers do you have across all social media
- Q10: How many average likes do you get on a post?

**I also asked demographic questions to see who was answering my survery, like:**

- Q11: What is your gender?
- Q12: What is your age?
- Q13: Which state/area do you live?
- Q14: What is your average income a month?

### The Results

After getting back the results of the survery, I learned that most of the respondents do or have had some sort of job in many fields. Most of the younger respondents have had only 1 or 2 jobs but almost all of the older suerveyees have had more than 3. Additionally, almost all have made at least some money outside of their main job, but have not made enough to susbstantially boost their spending money.

As for what people do in their freetime, almost everyone said sports and social media as their main response. This was mainly expected and when asked about what forms of social media, the most popular were tiktok and instagram. Most people said that they feel decently experienced in making posts on tiktok, instagram, etc., and many also have over 1000 combined followers on these platforms.

Based off this information, it is safest to say that most people do have jobs but are also looking to obtain extra funds on the side to boost their pocket money. Additionally, many people are actually invested in social media and sports, which we could use to our advantage.

### What I want to do

I want to go ahead and explore different side-hustle opportunities. I want to see for myself if those opportunites do actually bring additional revenue stream for me. Then, I will curate those list and make it presentable to my peers.
