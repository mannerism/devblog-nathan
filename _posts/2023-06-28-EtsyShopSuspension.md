## The Issue at Hand

Sadly enough, the first Etsy shop I setup weeks prior has been suspeneded. This is however, an issues many beginning Etsy shops will face for many unknown reasons. Even for my shop, I am not sure of the exact reason why my shop violated Etsy's terms of service. In this post, we will go over why some shops can get banned, what to do to avoid such issues, and the next steps in our Etsy Journey.

## What Went Wrong?

Like I said before, this is an issue that most starting shops will experience. While the error made by each shop can be very minimal, one wrong step can lead to suspension. Many of the most common issues are listed in this [article.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/uwrqck/account_suspension_help_checklist/?onetap_auto=true)

For instance, many problems may include:

- ID Verification
- Utility Bill Issue
- Age
- Legal Information
- Copyright Policies
- Counterfeiting

It is important to consider the cirumstance of your shop and contact an Etsy employee if you have any quesions. Everyone should have an email stating your shop's status and sometimes a reason as to why you were suspended/banned. Howver, sometimes Etsy will not even give an explanation. If this were to happen, then it is especially vital to talk to an Etsy helper.

In my case, I had to ask the Etsy Help Center what our main issue was to be suspended. However, there was no reply and I am still currently suspended. This is frustrating because going through the issues many other peopel have faced when being suspended, my shop seemed to follow all of these guidelines. Nevertheless, it will just take time to truly see what will happen.

## Whats Next?

Because I am still suspended, I believe the next best step will be to find an alternative marketplace. Though Etsy has many benefit such as a high prestige and great marketing potential, it clearly won't be sustainable if I am constantly suspended. As such, going through many sources, the best alternatives we have found are:

- TeePublic
- RedBubble
- TeeSpring
- Walmart Marketplace
- Ebay
- Direct selling

TeePublic, RedBubble, and TeeSpring are just a few of the many art based websites that allow creators to add their artwork to the website and then create clothing such as T-shirts, hoodies, and much more. The prices to manufacture are very cheap and the versatility in design and products make it just as good as an option compared to Etsy.

Walmart Marketplace and Ebay are more old-fashioned and well-known selling techniques. The big benefits of these marketplaces are the amount of consumers already flowing through the websites. Because of the high traffic already present, it would make selling my own clothing much easier. However, the process to ensure saftey and adherance to regulations may be a touch harder as the companies are much stricter in regulation.

**But what if you want to go off road?**

There are many options avaible for people looking to work away from big name corporations and instead thrive on their own. If this sounds like you, you are most certainly not alone.

One very prominent idea that I am pursuing as of now is using direct consumer selling of art created by Midjourney AI to the population of South Korea. Why this could work is because most of the populaiton is unaware of the capabilities Midjounrey AI has because it is an American based company that has not reached its signifigance in Korea.

As such, if I can create the art for those in South Korea using Midjourney AI, I can make a huge profit of the digital products that take me almost no effort in making. As a passive income stream, this idea could be revolutionary as the current environment in Korea is not familiar with Midjourney.
