## The Birth of the Etsy Shop

At this stage, I have created my Etsy Shop, 2ndChanceInc (Name still in progress), and have begun the process of establishing what I hope will be passive income in the long run.

Though it may take a lot of work and is not guaranteed to succeed, there are many methods and techniques I will dive into later that demonstrate how to overcome initial startup roadbloacks.

## The First Steps

The exact process in beginning an Etsy shop are as follows:

- **Stock your shop**: Start listing your products by clicking on the "Add a listing" button. Provide detailed information about each item, including photos, descriptions, pricing, and shipping details.

- **Set up payment and shipping options**: Determine how you want to accept payments from customers. Etsy offers various payment methods such as PayPal, credit cards, and more. Additionally, configure your shipping settings based on your location and the destinations you plan to ship to.

- **Establish shop policies**: Define your shop policies regarding returns, exchanges, shipping times, and any other relevant information. Clear and transparent policies help establish trust with potential buyers.

- **Promote your shop**: After opening your Etsy shop, promote it to drive traffic and gain customers. Utilize social media platforms, create engaging content, collaborate with influencers, and participate in Etsy communities to increase visibility.

## Stocking the Shop

When making the Etsy Shop, they require you to list your first item before opening the store. As such, I simply created a Teddy Bear Digital Download that was listed at $5.00. Why this was an interesting idea was because digital downloads are not difficult to sell.

By using Midjourney AI to create the download and pricing the bear at $5.00, I used almost no effort and was able to make my first listing. I later added a discount to drop it to 2.00, but as expected the one listing did not do spectacularly. Though it got a decent amount of views and a few clicks here and there, it made little progress.

## Set-up Payment and Shipping / Policies

Because I am a minor, I had to register my bank information under my dad's name. However, the profits will go into my dad and I's joint credit card account, meaning I will still have access to the money. The neccessary documents include a credit account, bank statements, and tax records to officially start the account.

The policies needed to establish were return policies, methods of shipping, and exchanges. Returns are typically allowed as this is the best option in creating returning customers. As with shipping, domestic is usually cheaper. Many sellers also offer free shipping by combining the manufacturing cost with the shipping cost. The policies of exchange are usually stock however, with most accepting credit cards, PayPal, etc.

## Promoting your Shop

To get the shop running smoothly, you need to show off your products to the world. To do this most efficiently, you could resort to either onsite or offsite ads. While onsite ads are offered through the Etsy store feed, offsite ads are shown on Google, Facebook, etc.

Onsite ads are known to be much cheaper and efficient as Etsy's algorithm is very good at optimizing the efficieny of its ads. This means that many more people are going to see your ads based off their searches and interests. Though it is around $0.2-0.5 per click, these costs are quickly offset if you make good sales. As such, to make the most of your ads, the sales you make should either be in bulk for cheaper items or in smaller ammounts but at much higher prices.
