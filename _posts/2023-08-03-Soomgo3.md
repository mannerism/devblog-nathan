## The most important thing

The most important thing to build a successful business is customer satisfaction. Initially, I thought this mantra was just a set of buzzwords. However, after having direct interactions with customers through Soomgo, I now understand why it's crucial. **Customer satisfaction is directly related to the sales potential.** In other words, satisfied customers will attract more customers in the future, resulting in a positive chain reaction that propels your business to thrive in the market.

Getting the first customer is hard, but making that customer fall in love with your product or service is even harder than you might anticipate. This realization dawned on me after delivering my first digital product to an end-user. Let me share the steps I took to make the digital product more appealing to my first Soomgo customer.

## Easy Mode

The easiest way to deliver an illustration is to feed the prompt to `Midjourney` or any other Gen AI alternatives to generate images. You can then send those generated images directly to the customer.

### Easy Mode PROS

- Fast: Generating images only takes about a minute each
- Can cater to many concurrent customers

### Easy Mode CONS

- Low-quality image: Many Gen AIs like `Midjourney` don't support `upscaling` out of the box.
    > There will be a dedicated post on the Generative AI guide soon.
- Images with background: People tend to perceive images with no background as higher quality work.

## Normal Mode

To address the cons from the `easy mode`, we can make use of readily available `Software-as-a-Service` like `removal.ai` to remove the background color of an image. The advantage of the current 2023 AI boom is that these providers offer a generous free-tier to attract customers away from their competitors, which is beneficial for customers at the moment!

Here are some useful websites you can use for background removal and upscaling images:

### Background Removal

- [removal.ai](https://removal.ai/)
- [remove bg](https://www.remove.bg/upload)

### Upscaling Image

- [upscayl](https://www.upscayl.org/)

### Normal Mode PROS

- Easy to use
- Not overly time-consuming - approximately 10-20 minutes increase at most.
- Improved customer satisfaction.

### Normal Mode CONS

- Can cost money: Even though these service providers advertise generous free-tiers, we are still dependent on their decisions, and they might change their policies quickly.
- Quality is still not top-notch: I sometimes notice specks on the edges of an image after using AI-powered background removal tools.
- Technology is still in its experimental stage.

## Hard Mode

If the highest quality is your priority, in my opinion, nothing can replace Adobe `Photoshop` and `Illustrator`. It may seem paradoxical to return to `Illustrator` after our initial attempt to create an illustration with Gen AI, but we are only utilizing a small, rather simple functionality of the Adobe Suite, namely `Remove Background` from `Photoshop` and `Tracing` from `Illustrator`. In many cases, you might be able to complete the entire job using only `Photoshop`.

Removing backgrounds can be a tricky task in image editing. I recommend checking out [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF1kYrMzVnI&ab_channel=CristiKerekes), and [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4vsJkrZTcI&ab_channel=RanaKamranSharjeel) to remove backgrounds without losing the original image quality.

Upscaling is also a straightforward process in Adobe `Photoshop`. You can check out [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvsLnfewUwg&ab_channel=WajahatPhotoshop) for upscaling an image.

Photoshop's `macro` functionality is also very powerful if you find yourself performing repetitive tasks. [Here is a helpful guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APk9QQ3CQYE&ab_channel=2-MinuteDesign).

### Hard Mode PROS

- Guaranteed best image quality
- Low dependency on third-party solutions
- High customer satisfaction
- Opportunity to familiarize yourself with professional, production-ready imaging tools

### Hard Mode CONS

- There is a learning curve if you are not already familiar with the software. However, there are many detailed YouTube guides available that can make the learning process easier.
- Time-consuming: Compared to the previous two modes, `Easy` and `Normal`, achieving the desired results with `Photoshop` or `Illustrator` takes more time. In my experience, approximately 1.5 to 2 hours more.
- Cost: You have to pay for the Adobe Suite, which can result in a monthly expense. If you are a student, you may benefit from a student discount.

## Delivering the product

By researching how designers collaborate with clients, I realized that on average, designers provide 3-4 different options for each client's request. Therefore, I sent several options to choose from, and the customer was satisfied with the last one I provided. I sent the same image with different quality variations, namely (1) no-background, (2) with-background, (3) upscaled, and (4) original, and the customer was pleased. Mission Accomplished!

## Conclusion

I highly recommend trying all three modes I explained in this post. This way, you can gradually deepen your skills step-by-step. Throughout the process, I learned about the world of image processing and the various expertise currently in high demand in this sector. This could definitely be a great business sector to be involved in at this moment.
