## General Interview

In this week, my goal was to figure out similarities within the general population and how to best meet these terms. To do this, I asked basic questions that were aimed at seeing people's daily routines, waht they enjoyed doing, and what kind of basic problems they face daily.

To create the most effective and beneficial understanding of what people want and need, it is important to make simple yet detailed questions to get multiple perspectives. With these many ideas, we can create patterns and understand what it is that most people agree on.

### What I Learned

From this general interivew, I learned that, just like me, most people live similar lives. With this interview taking place right after school ended, mostly all the interviewees are in the same stage of being out of school. This leads to them either having fun with friends and family or working at a job.

With this, the problems many of them have are also similar such as procrastination being of the most popular choices of Q3. Because so many of the problems I have received in the interview are so general and broad, only a miracle would be able to solve them compeltely. This has taught me that next time I conduct an interview, it will have to rely more on specific quesitons that has the potential to be unique for every person. In having a different response from every person, many more opportunties can arise as well as similarities will form that can give me an understanding of where my next step should start.
