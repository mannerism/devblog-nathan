## Context of the Situation

After a casual conversation with a friend from South Korea, a hugely innovative idea came to mind. He complained that many of the amazing stores such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and many other stores are not offered in-person or sometimes not even digitally. As such, when he moved from the U.S. to South Korea, he was cut off from a valuable source of discounted clothes, accessories, and other essential goods. This lead to a new idea: what if we made it possible for those in South Korea to still access these stores in the States?

## The New Idea

Based on this very common need, the idea of a digital marketplace emerged. By using TikTok Live, our goal is to allow the customers from any country to join the TikTok as a cohost. Once the customer is in the live-stream, the shopper (the original host) would walk around the store and show the customer possible clothes to buy. Then, the customer can choose whatever clothes they see fit to their eye.

This is great solution for international buyers looking for a new style or type of clothing as well as those who simply don't want to leave their homes. The easy accessibility for customers to simply watch the screen and say yes or no to certain items is the definition of efficiency.

In addition, it incorporates the benefit of in-person shopping as the buyer can talk about the material the shirt is made of, talk about size of the clothing, and even just give their opinion on the item iteself. Rather than being exposed to every item as you would on an online store, the buyer can exclude some of the less popular clothing that people wouldn't want to see.

## What's the Plan?

To execute my plan to make this a reality, I will have to accomplish many necessary steps. Many of these include:

- Establishing a reliable connection while on TikTok live or another streaming platform.
- Matching the buyer's schedule to find the right time to buy clothes.
- Understanding what kinds of clothes that are hot on the market and what people would want to wear.
- How to ship the bought clothes to the customers.
- How to make profit off of the overall process.
- What to price the products to include shipping and a royalty.

Overall, this idea is very interesting and I believe it will have lots of potential. The prices of many of these clothes in South Korea are much more expensive. Thus, even though I raise the price of selling these clothes from U.S. retailers, it will most likley still be cheaper than stock prices of South Korean retailers. This process has a bright outcome in sight.
