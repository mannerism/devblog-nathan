## How did it Go?

Overall, the experience was largely a success. With the large amounts of clothes in stock at a very cheap price, I was able to find many clothes for my friend, my first investor, as well as his friends in Korea. Buying 16 total items for $245, we saved hundreds of dollars on clothes that day alone. The brands we bought include:

- New Balance
- Nike
- Under Armor
- Balance Collection
- Nautica
- Hurley
- O'Neal

All clothes were new, and all cheaper than `$20`. Some even being less than `$12`. This value is incredibly powerful in our side-hustle mission and shows great signs.

## The Details

After buying the clothes, the next step is to send them to the customer. I researched many opportunities, and the shipping cost could be a major issue. USPS and FedEx are ridiculously expensive when it comes to this oversea shipping. The costs can be around `$300+`, and this would ruin our business. As such, I looked further and found that Korean based shipping companies are much cheaper.

The best option I found was called KT Express which was not only under $50, but also takes just as long if not less time to ship to Korea. As such, using this option will be most profitable and reasonable long-term. The only downside is that I have to ship the package to California first so that it can be picked up, but the costs are still exponentially cheaper this way so it is no problem.

## What to Consider

Now that I tried the whole process, I will need to figure out what to charge the customers. This would include buying the actual clothes, shipping it to Korea or other international locations, and an added royalty so I can still make profit.

When pricing items, there are several factors to consider to ensure that customers won't be upset, These include:

- Cost of clothes at original price: This price will be much higher than that given at TJMaxx, which can be utilized for my profits. However, customers will still expect a decently cheaper price even with the royalty, so I need to refrain from making it too expensive.
- Value proposition: Due to the lack of competitiors in this process, I can most likley make a lot of profit from the service I'm providing. This means that adding the royalty is justified.
- Pricing objectives: By maximizing profit margins, gaining market share, and achieving a certain sales volume, I can gain a larger business operation and overall increase the size of our idea. Thus, the price will be very important to help us match these goals.
- Pricing psychology: Strategies such as using charm pricing (e.g., pricing an item at $9.99 instead of $10) or providing clear price differentials to create a perception of value will be important so that I can ensure customers are getting the best deal possible while still making profits.
