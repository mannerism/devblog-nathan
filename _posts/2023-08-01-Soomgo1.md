## What is Soomgo?

Soomgo is a freelancing platform in South Korea where people with different expertise can list their skills. Customers can then reach out to these experts for project-based tasks. For example, if I need help with design or illustration, I can post my job requirements on Soomgo. The platform will send requests to the listed experts, who can then individually contact me with suggested pricing and other project details. Once I find an expert whose offer I like, I can directly communicate with them and make the payment, either through card payment or direct bank transfer.

## Why Soomgo?

There are several reasons why I find Soomgo appealing:

1. **Fast customer engagement and easy expert listing:**
  Soomgo has made it incredibly easy for anyone interested in showcasing their expertise on the platform. All you need to do is provide a detailed description of your services and share a portfolio. You can further optimize the visibility of your expertise through SEO tags, which is just a few clicks away.

2. **Maintain anonymity:**
  You don't need to disclose your legal full name or submit any legal documentation to verify your identity on Soomgo. As long as your work is genuine, you're good to go.

3. **Teenager-friendly:**
  The platform is accessible to teenagers, as they don't have to reveal their complete identity. This allows them to contribute and add value to the platform.

4. **Large customer base:**
  Approximately one-fifth of the South Korean population uses Soomgo for their daily tasks.

## Opportunity in Soomgo with AI Images

Generative AI has significantly changed the design industry, particularly the illustration or creative drawing part of the industry. There is an active, ongoing debate on how to regulate such creative works by artificial intelligence, but nothing is set in stone. This very gap between the current regulations in place and what the market (people) desire is what we call the 'gray zone,' and this offers tremendous business opportunities.

### Current State of Creating an Illustration or Artwork

Let's say you want to create an illustration or a digital artwork for your new cafe business. If you don't have the proper skills and resources to make your own illustration, the only option you have is to hire someone who can do that for you. This is why a platform like 'Soomgo' exists. It allows you to find those experts with greater ease by simply posting a request with a few clicks and a description of your needs. Then, your request is sent to the designers registered on the Soomgo platform. These designers then send their quotes and prices for your requested job, and you can choose from those quotes based on your needs and budget.

### The Gray Zone

The current problem with illustration work is that it's time-consuming. After all, it requires the designer to come up with a brand new design concept. The process can take up to 3 months, depending on the intensity of work, and the price can go as high as $3,000, easily.

This is where generative AI comes into play. With an appropriate image prompt, anyone can create new images in a matter of minutes. Most importantly, the cost of creating images using generative AI technology is practically zero. Some charge monthly fees of $39.99 with generated image copyrights included, but considering the fact that you can generate as much as approximately 100,000 images per month, the cost of creating images using gen AI is arguably negligible. There are many tips and tricks to generate images that perfectly match your needs, but this part can also be aided with the help of chat-based generative AI, most popularly ChatGPT.

I see an opportunity here. People in South Korea are less knowledgeable about image generative AI and its full potential, since these technologies are all built and maintained in English. I want to test this tech in the South Korean market and see for myself if it's a plausible side-hustle opportunity.
